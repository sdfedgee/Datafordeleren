# Datafordeleren

Go to the WIKI and read about how to we suggest the new Datafordeler be implemented. Link: https://github.com/WROFF/Datafordeleren/wiki

Large governmental solutions should be open source and easy to maintain and move between local and internatinal cloud providers, such as Amazon Webservices (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. High security and reliability is a prerequisite.

WROFF.com and OpenRPA.dk have joined forces to promote the use of OpenRPA as a platform for the new version of the Danish Datafordeler. OpenRPA is open source and can be found on GitHub. Link: https://github.com/open-rpa/openrpa

WROFF and OprnRPA are both small companies that need support from a large organization that can front the project. The deadline for the pre-proposal is in December.

It is a commercial market and we all must eat. We are open to discussing any compensation model. We do this to make a great solution and earn money for all.
