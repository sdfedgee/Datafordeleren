# Datafordeleren

Go to the WIKI and read about how to we suggest the new Datafordeler be implemented. Link: https://github.com/WROFF/Datafordeleren/wiki

Large governmental solutions should be open source and easy to maintain and move between supplies. High security and reliability is a prerequisite.

WROFF.com and OpenRPA.dk have joined forces to promote the use of OpenRPA as a platform for the new version of the Danish Datafordeler. OpenRPA is open source and can be found on GitHub. Link: https://github.com/open-rpa/openrpa

WROFF and OprnRPA are both small companies that need support from a large organization that can front the project. The deadline for the pre-proposal is in December.

It is a commercial market and we all must eat. We are open to discussing any compensation model. We do this to make a great solution and earn money for all.
